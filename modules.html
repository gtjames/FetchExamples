  //  this code works great
  //  first of all the script block specifies that it is a module.
  //  Hence it knows about cool stuff like import
  import { sqRoot, getUrlVar, favNum, randNum } from './basicMath.js';

  //    lets try to get a number from the URL param 'num'
  let num = getUrlVar('num');           //  get the value of the URL param: num
  if (typeof num === 'undefined') {     //  not there? use the favNum which came from our import file
      num = favNum;                     // default to the favorite number
  }

  let ans = sqRoot(num);                //  calculate the Square Root

  //  push to the web page for fun
  document.body.innerHTML += `The square root of ${num} is ${ans}<br>`;

  //    let's also generate a random number using our imported randNum function 
  //        which is also a fat arrow function
  document.body.innerHTML += `Random number less than ${num} is ${randNum(num)}<br>`;

  // The code here is showing a BAD way to use an imported function
  // after you have seen that the sqRoot code below does not work.
  //        console.log(num);     //    Uncomment this line
  // you will see that the variable num is not visible between script blocks either
  // it is as if the script tag inserts an opening and closing set of curly braces around the code,
  // thus scope blocking everything in the tag

  //  now uncomment the 
  //        let ans = sqRoot(441);    //  sqRoot is undefined. We cannot get past this point
  //        document.body.innerHTML += `The square root of 441 is ${ans}<br>`;
  //  looking in the console you will see that this code does not work
  //  What are your thoughts on why that is?
  //  it seems like if we imported the file from above it would still be visible
  //  but that is not how modules work. The SCOPE of the imports is just in that script tag
  //    so sqRoot is NOT visible here
